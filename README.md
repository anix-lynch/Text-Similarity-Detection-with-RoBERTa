## 🧠 Detecting Similarity in English Texts with RoBERTa

In this project, we’re using the **RoBERTa** model to tackle the task of detecting similarity between English texts. The goal is to fine-tune the powerful RoBERTa model on a dataset of paraphrases and evaluate how well it can determine how similar two pieces of text are. Sounds fun? Let’s dive in! 😎

## Project Overview

RoBERTa is a transformer-based language model that builds on BERT, with improvements like more training data and the removal of the next sentence prediction task. It’s great for a variety of NLP tasks, and in this project, we’re using it for **text similarity detection**.

The dataset we’re working with is the **Webis Crowd Paraphrase Corpus 2011**, and we’ll be using **Hugging Face's Transformers library** to load a pretrained RoBERTa model. After tokenizing the data, we’ll split it into training, validation, and test sets. Then, using **PyTorch** and **Transformers**, we’ll fine-tune the model and evaluate its performance with accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix.

### Key Features:

- 📚 **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the Webis Crowd Paraphrase Corpus 2011 dataset for training.
- 🤖 **RoBERTa Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune a pretrained RoBERTa model for similarity detection.
- 🎯 **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and visualize results with a confusion matrix.
- ⚙️ **Custom Training**: Set custom training arguments like learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
